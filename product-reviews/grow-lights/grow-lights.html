      <div class='pagetitle'>The Best Grow Lights for Your Hydroponic Garden</div>

      <div class="body">Grow lights are a necessity for almost all indoor hydroponic systems. They can provide extra
        light during the dark
        winter months or be the sole form of light for your plants.

        We have researched the best grow lights available online. The best were picked by efficiency, cost, brightness,
        and ease
        of use. Here are the best grow lights for your system.

        <div class="heading">Things to Keep in Mind</div>

        <div class="body">First of all, check out our guide on How to Choose the Best Grow Lights for your Hydroponic
          System
        </div>

        <div class="subheading">Size
        </div>

        <div class="body">Think about the size of your system, how much space are you going to need to cover? Can the
          light come from one source
          or do you need multiple fixtures? Are you going to need to move the light from time to time? If so don't
          choose
          something heavy or delicate. If the light is going to get hot, you can't put it next to curtains or drapes.
        </div>

        <div class="subheading">Wattage</div>

        <div class="body">having enough light is important for your hydroponic system. If you're using LEDs, the wattage
          will be very low. This is
          because LEDs are more efficient and produce less heat. With LEDs, you need around 6 watts per square foot and
          with
          fluorescents, you need about 32 watts per square foot.
        </div>

        <div class="bodyContinued">Be sure to think about how you will mount your lights. Many products here include
          their own hanging mechanisms.

        <div class="description">For an option that will just get the job done, choose Barrina Grow Lights.
          These lights will
          work best with a rack set
          up, or to provide extra light at windows. It’s not going to be winning any awards for design, but that's
          what makes it
          cheap. We wish it had reflectors included to help point light in the direction of plants though. The
          pinkish-white light
          is the ultimate general light color for hydroponic plants. They are two feet long and provide full-spectrum
          light. As
          they are LEDs, the 40W consumption is equal to a 250W fluorescent light. Don't get these lights if you plan
          to separate
          them, you only get 2 power cords and 4 connector pieces, so you have to use them in groups. Barrina is our
          favorite grow
          light maker, and this isn't their only light on this list. We gave it the top spot for its price-to-watt
          ratio, ease of
          setup, and brightness.

        <div class="description">Compact and powerful, Aidyu’s grow light is packing a punch. The Veg mode provides a
          blueish light for growth and the
          Bloom light provides a reddish light for the flowing phase. You can combine the two to produce yellow light.
          Two cooling
          fans keep the LEDs cool, which extends the life of the lights. The wattage consumption is higher than
          expected, but this
          is due to the cooling fans. Lights can be daisy-chained together. But with how powerful this is, we would be
          surprised
          if you needed more than one. Hanging lines are included, but you will need to figure out what to attach the
          carabiner
          to. We wish you could install your lights another way, but Aidyu doesn’t provide another option. Aidyu
          provides special
          dark glasses to wear while the light is on. Probably a little extreme, but it’s nice.

        <div class="description">Perfect for a small setup, this bendy light can reach wherever you need light. It’s
          best for starting seeds or a
          desk-sized hydroponics setup. The arms have aluminum fins on the back to dissipate heat. The 12W consumption
          is closer
          to producing 75W of light equivalent than the advertised 150W light equivalent. We wish it could remember
          its
          last
          powered state, so you could use an external timer or save time when turning it back on. The dimmer is great,
          but the
          light isn’t super bright, to begin with. We would be surprised if you ever touched the dimmer. It even comes
          with a few
          miniature garden tools! They make good decoration and the spade can be used to repot plants.</div>

          concede that they do look beautiful
          and are easy to use. If you’re looking for something cheaper that's also small, check out our 5-gallon
          bucket
          guide. We
          were confused by their decision to use a water pump instead of an air pump. You need an air pump to add
          oxygen
          to the
          water, not the included water pump. Plant food is included with the purchase. There are germination caps to
          increase
          humidity while the plants are germinating. While the light is adjustable, it can't go up super high. Plants
          like chives
          will grow past the highest setting. If you need to clean the system, you will have to take the whole system
          apart. Some
          customers have s small issues, but the customer service is fast and nice.

          cheap.
          While it

        <div class="description">One reviewer said these were “Visible from the International Space Station”. These
          are
          bright! The use of purple light
          further increases the amount of light plants can absorb. The reflector they include can increase light
          getting
          to plants
          by 20%. If you dont want to get a 6 pack, barrina sells these lights in several different sizes and
          quantities. We
          recommend replacing the clips they use to hold up the lights, the lights have broken out of the clips and
          smashed into
          the plants too many times to count. The only thing to look out for is that they only provide 3 plugs for
          the
          lights. The
          remainder must be daisy chained together.

        <div class="description">HPS lamps used to be the king of the growing industry until LEDs replaced them. HPS
          are
          not a efficient as LEDs, but
          they have a cheaper initial cost. The bulb must be replaced if it breaks or it starts to get dimmer. These
          are
          also
          great if you need to heat a room while growing your plants. It comes with a flowering bulb, so it is best
          to
          purchase a
          vegetative bulb with your lamp.
