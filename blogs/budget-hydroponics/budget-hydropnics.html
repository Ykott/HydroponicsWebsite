      <div class="subtitle">How to reduce costs in your hydroponic system.
      </div>
      <div class="body">On the surface level, hydroponic gardening is the best choice for gardening. What could be
        better than quicker plant
        growth, higher quality crops, and more efficient production? However, as you get deeper into hydroponics,
        you'll
        realize
        it requires a decent-sized initial investment, a ton of work, and some recurring costs. So is hydroponics
        worth
        it
        financially?
      </div>
      <div class="bodyContinued">YES. It’s an easy answer, yes. Hydroponics is 100% worth it. Modern hydroponic
        systems
        are designed to maximize profits
        while reducing long-term costs. Once you are up and running, you can expect higher plant production, quicker
        plant
        growth, and cheap, nutritious vegetables. Following the guide below, you can increase the profits of your
        system
        even
        more. Let's go!</div>

      <div class="heading">What is Hydroponics?</div>
      <div class="body">Before we get started, let us review what hydroponics is precisely. Hydroponics is the
        practice
        of growing plants
        without soil. Sound impossible? I know. In hydroponics, plants are grown in an inert medium such as Rockwool
        (a
        fibrous
        material woven into squares), expanded clay pebbles (small fired clay balls), or perlite (an excavated mineral
        rock).
        Water is run through the medium to water the plants, and fertilizer is added to the water to supply nutrients
        and
        promote healthy growth. Hydroponics systems recirculate the water to provide an effective growth environment.
        Due to the
        constant water supply and nutrients, hydroponic systems grow plants faster, at a higher quality, and are more
        space
        efficient. If you need a more in-depth explanation of hydroponics, check out <a
          href="../hydro-guide/hydro-guide.html">our guide.</a>

      <img src="Photos/calculate.jpg" alt="calculatot">
      <div class="heading">Step 1. Calculate your Current Costs</div>
      <div class="body">Arguably both the most important and least important step. If you don't have a system yet,
        skip
        this part. First, figure
        out how much you’re spending per garden harvest. Make sure to include water, nutrients, lights, heating, and
        anything
        else you regularly spend on your systems. Then, calculate the expected “revenue” of your system. Next,
        calculate
        how
        much money you’re saving by not purchasing those vegetables from the store. This isn’t a perfect
        representation
        of your
        ‘revenue”, but it will do. Finally, subtract your cost from your revenue to find your expected “profit” per
        harvest.
        Hopefully, this is a positive number. If it’s not, don't worry. After you apply the methods below, you'll be
        in
        good
        shape.

      <div class="heading">For Beginners</div>
      <div class="body">These tips are easy for everyone—the low-hanging fruit of hydroponics. So consider doing
        these;
        they’re easy and save
        tons of money.</div>

      <div class="subheading">Improve Water Use</div>
      <div class="body">Hydroponics already has AMAZING water use. There are only a couple of points of weakness in a
        hydroponic system
        water-wise. First, consider using an ozone purification system or ultraviolet system to eliminate the need to
        replace
        the water. Water replacement is hard to do, a waste of nutrients, and slightly expensive. Second, consider
        covering your
        hydroponic system to keep as much moisture in the system as possible. Plants lose a lot of water through
        transpiration,
        the “exhalation” of water vapor from the plant into the air. By keeping moisture in, a constant amount of
        water
        vapor in
        the air will slow the transpiration process. We have a great guide on reusing wastewater; <a href="../">check
          it
          out.</a></div>
      <img src="Photos/sunlight.jpg" alt="sunlight">
      <div class="subheading">Use Natural Light</div>
      <div class="body">If your hydroponic system uses artificial light, try moving it somewhere it can get some
        natural
        light. Even if you
        can’t wholly sever artificial light from your hydroponic system, you may be able to cut down on the lights
        needed.
        Reducing your artificial light dependence will not only cut down on the energy bill. You can sell your
        leftover
        lights
        or use those lights to expand your current system.
      </div>
      <img src="Photos/liquid-fertilizer.jpg" alt="no liquid fertilizer">
      <div class="subheading">Avoid Liquid Fertilizers</div>
      <div class="body">Liquid fertilizers have some intrinsic advantages; they are easy to apply and homogenous, but
        they are HEAVY. They
        contain a lot of water, which is expensive to ship and package. For every pound of fertilizer shipped, more
        than
        one
        pound of water is also shipped (costly!). This will increase the cost of fertilizer massively. Consider
        switching to
        solid fertilizers or better, see “Prepare your Own Fertilizers” below.
      </div>
      <img src="Photos/diy.jpg" alt="diy">
      <div class="subheading">Build your System DIY</div>
      <div class="body">Typical hydroponic systems sold by large retailers are overpriced consumer garbage, in my 100%
        correct opinion of course
        :). The all-in-one plug-in-play systems are fantastic in that you don't need to buy anything else, but they
        charge a
        hefty premium. Not only that, but most of those systems are utter garbage. They use cheap materials, can’t
        grow
        much,
        and seem to exist just to look pretty. Two easy ways to solve this: shop local or build your own. Local stores
        tend to
        have lower prices and better offerings for all-in-one systems. Just don't buy a mass-market one from a local
        store, that
        kind of defeats the purpose. If you choose to build your own, don’t be intimidated by the complexity of
        hydroponics.
        Start small and slowly grow, spend time researching what you need before buying, and pay attention to your
        plants.

      <div class="heading">Advanced</div>

      <div class="body">These are a little harder to implement, or they require more knowledge to implement. However,
        some of these could REALLY
        save you some money.</div>

      <div class="subheading">Make your Own Foliar Treatment</div>
      <div class="body">Foliar treatments are fertilizers applied directly to the leaves instead of roots. Plants can
        rapidly transport
        nutrients through their stomata into the plants, leading to faster growth. In devoted operations, foliar
        spraying is a
        no-brainer in your crop cycle. Foliar sprays are expensive, but they can be inexpensive if you prepare your
        own
        solutions.</div>


      <div class="subheading">Use your Own Silicon Additives</div>
      <div class="body">Many growers don't use silicate-containing additives on their crops and from that, have a much
        greater chance of fungi
        growth ruining their plants. Potassium silicate is exceptionally cheap, and you can make silicon additives
        from
        it to
        protect your crop against fungal diseases. Consider doing it even if you’re not currently using a silicon
        additive. The
        small expense of purchasing potassium silicate can save you from plant loss and headaches down the line.</div>

      <div class="subheading">Farm Vertically</div>
      <div class="body">This may seem counterintuitive, but it is worth it in some situations. Going upwards saves you
        money on heating,
        reservoirs, pumps, and water. Not to mention it’s going to save you space, maybe that’s important too. If you
        think thats cool, we've got a <a href="../vertical_gardening/vertical_gardening.html">guide on it</a></div>

      <div class="subheading">Prepare your own fertilizers
      </div>
      <div class="body">If you are using a premade fertilizer or worse, a liquid fertilizer (see “Avoid Liquid
        Fertilizers” above), consider
        preparing your own fertilizers. It can save you money and allow for greater control of your fertilizer. Making
        your own
        fertilizer is simple. First, research your plants' macronutrient and micronutrient needs and order what you
        need. If
        that's too complicated, many companies sell the micronutrient parts, and then you can prepare the macro
        fertilizer blend
        yourself. Bulk macronutrients are incredibly cheap and widely available.

      <img src="Photos/keyboard.jpg" alt="keyboard with plants growing out of it">
      <div class="subheading">Reduce Labor
      </div>
      <div class="body">Yes, you will need to spend more to do this. Automate some parts of your system. You can add
        nutrients automatically,
        monitor water quality, and turn off the lights without a touch. It will save you time and be fun to do for
        some.
        We
        know; why would you spend more money when you’re not saving any? Isn’t the whole point of this article to save
        money?
        Well, by automating, you'll save time and time = money. BOOM, “money” saved.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">How to Implement These Strategies
      </div>
      <div class="body">Consider a few things if you’re hesitant to try some of these. First, the internet has
        limitless
        resources on each of
        these topics. You can fully flesh out your knowledge of these topics before you try them. Also, these are the
        best of
        the best cost-saving ideas. We wouldn’t be giving them to you if we didn’t honestly think they were worth it.
        When you
        are ready to give them a shot, start small. Only apply a few strategies at a time to a small part of your
        system
        to see
        if they work without risking all of your crops.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">These changes can help a personal or commercial operation save tons of cash per year
        in
        nutrients, additives, and crop
        loss. So, consider implementing them; even just a few can help your operation save lots.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">Questions
      </div>

      <div class="body">Some of the tips above can be challenging to implement. I wouldn't recommend them for
        beginners,
        especially the advanced
        ones. Please, don't hesitate to contact us if you have questions, even simple ones. Hydroponics is best when
        you
        don't
        fail, but failure is inevitable and can be reduced with research and confidence. So reach out!
