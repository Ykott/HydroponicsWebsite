      <div class="bodyContinued">If you’re building your hydroponic system indoors, or you’re in need of extra light,
        you need to grow lights. Grow
        lights are probably the most essential item for your hydroponic system, and there are so many options. Each
        light has
        its advantages and disadvantages. We’ve collected all of the information on hydroponic grow lights for this
        guide to
        help guide you through this challenging process. We will start by looking at how plants use light and how light
        is measured
      </div>

      <div class="heading">How Plants use Light
      </div>

      <img src="photos/phototsynthesis.jpg" alt="photosynthesis cycle for hydroponic grow lights">

      <div class="body">Plants rely on the energy in sunlight to produce the nutrients they need.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">The process starts with chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a light-absorbing pigment inside of
        chloroplasts, an organelle of a
        plant cell. Chlorophyll absorbs energy from blue and red light waves and reflects green. This is why plants are
        green.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Energy from the light is used to facilitate a reaction between CO2 and H2O. In the
        cell, the water is oxidized while the
        carbon dioxide is reduced forming O2 and glucose molecules.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Without light, plants are unable to go through the photosynthetic process. They cannot
        continue to grow and produce. If
        there is too little light, the photosynthetic process will not occur quickly enough and the plant will become
        limp and
        white.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">How Light Output is Measured
      </div>

      <img src="photos/lumens-to-watts.jpg" alt="lumens to watts conversion with hydroponic grow lights">

      <div class="body">Each bulb produces a different amount of light.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">There a several ways to measure light level. Overall, they all mean the same thing.
        Some are nearly obsolete due to
        their lack of relatability anymore. Foot candles/ candle power used to be used, especially in the flashlight
        industry,
        but the term “candle power” means a lot less than it used to.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Lumens is another scale used to measure light output. We do see this used a lot, again
        in the flashlight industry, It is
        a reflection of how bright a light is. This is great for seeing how well something will light up a room but
        doesn’t tell
        the full story for grow lights. The light required for plants goes beyond the physical spectrum, so lumens
        cannot
        represent the power of a hydroponic grow light.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Wattage is most commonly used to measure grow light output. Higher wattage means more
        light and energy being input into
        the system. Wattage can be further broken down into Watts per area to display how much energy is being output to
        each
        plant. When it comes to growing plants, it is generally said that plants need 20-30 watts of light per square
        foot. But
        even wattage does not tell the full story Some lights are more efficient than others, and some lights do not
        produce the
        full spectrum of light.
      </div>

      <img src="photos/kelvin-color.jpg" alt="color system to measure hydroponic grow lights">

      <div class="bodyContinued">Color temperature is also a primary metric in light output. Color temperature refers to
        the color of light compared to
        the natural color of light produced by the sun. “Cooler” color temperature lights produce light on the blue end
        of the
        spectrum, and “warmer” lights produce light towards the red end of the spectrum. Different color temperature is
        best for
        different plants and setups. If you can't figure out what color temperature is best for you, get a full spectrum
        of
        natural color temperature light.
      </div>


      <div class="bodyContinued">Light is measured by its wavelength too. Visible light has a wavelength of 400 to 700
        nanometers (nm). A red light is
        700nm, and violet light is closer to 400nm. Typical indoor grow lights have a range of 450 to 700 nm.</div>

      <div class="heading">Types of Grow Lights
      </div>

      <div class="body">There are many different grow lights and many different types of grow lights. Each has its
        advantages and disadvantages.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">Fluorescent Lights
      </div>

      <div class="body">Fluorescent lights are composed of a glass tube, argon gas, and mercury gas. Electricity is used
        to excite the gas
        particles and produce light. Fluorescent lights have been the most common grow light used in the industry for a
        long
        time, and for a good reason. They are very economical to run. Another significant benefit of fluorescent bulbs
        is
        they
        run pretty cool, so bulbs can be placed very close to plants without the risk of burning them. This can increase
        efficiency in that you use your light.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">T5 Lights
      </div>

      <img src="photos/t5-lights.jpg" alt="fluorescent hydroponic grow lights">

      <div class="body">A type of fluorescent light that uses T5 bulbs to grow plants. They are not super powerful, but
        they are widespread. T5
        lamps are not only used in grow lights but in warehouses and other industrial lighting. The name T5 comes from
        the
        5/8th
        in diameter of the lamp. Also, T5 lamps are claimed to be up to 4 times as efficient as standard fluorescent
        bulbs. T5
        lights are the cheapest grow lights available, and they are pretty energy efficient too, converting
        approximately
        15% of
        their electrical energy to light, but not as efficient as LEDs. T5s come in lengths of 2 feet and 4 feet, most
        commonly.
        Most fixtures hold either 1,2,4,8, or 12 tubes, so the setup is very customizable.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">T5 lights tend to output light towards the blue end of the spectrum. This is optimal
        for
        plants that do not flower to
        fruit, like lettuce. T5 lights may not be optimal for plants that grow produce, like tomatoes, but they will
        still
        work
        fine.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">HID Lights
      </div>

      <img src="photos/hid-lights.jpg" alt="HID hydroponic grow lights">

      <div class="body">Also known as high-Intensity discharge lights, these lights are heavy-duty. They work by sending
        an electrical discharge
        between the ends and exciting the ionized gas within. HID lights are dimmable, so you can customize your light.
        In
        addition, they produce tons of UV rays, a necessity for plant growth not found in other types of lights. UV rays
        help
        plants produce essential oils (as a “sunblock”), which can enhance the flavor and smell of produce.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">HID lights come in two types:
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Metal Halid: Electric current is passed through mercury and metal halide gas to produce
        light. The light produced is
        towards the bluer end of the spectrum, so it is excellent for the vegetative stage (after germination and before
        flowering) and non-flowering plants.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">High-Pressure Sodium: This combination of metals and gasses produces light toward the
        red
        end of the spectrum. Red light
        is best suited for the flowering stage (when the fruit is grown).
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">HIDs lose their light intensity over time. After 10,000 hours, the light produces about
        70% less than its initial
        output. Ten thousand hours is 416 days, but if you run your lights for 18 hours daily, you'll get 555 days out
        of
        them.
        So this is a significant disadvantage of HID lights. Also, HID lights get hot; You can't have them close to the
        plants,
        or you risk burning them.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">LED Lights
      </div>

      <img src="photos/led-lights.jpg" alt="led hydroponic grow lights">

      <div class="body">LEDs are a new introduction to the hydroponics space. It took a while for LEDs to enter the
        space
        due to confusion on if
        they produced good full spectrum light for plants. The lights are a little more expensive, but over time the
        advantages
        in efficiency will pay for it. As they gain more popularity, prices will fall. Unfortunately, some manufacturers
        sell
        cheap LEDs that aren't strong enough for the flowing phase. To avoid this, only purchase lights rated at two
        micromoles
        per watt at a minimum.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">LEDs produce almost no heat; they are 90% efficient. They can be placed directly on the
        plants with no downsides.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Some LED lights only include red and blue diodes, not green. This cuts down on cost,
        increases efficiency, and produces
        a purple light. Since plants reflect most green light, these lights are super efficient. However, they do look
        ugly to
        some, and it is hard to see discoloration in the plants, so be careful.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">Induction Lighting</div>

      <div class="body">These are very similar to fluorescent lights and work in a similar manner. They operate in the
        same way as fluorescents,
        but magnets ignite the gas. So no lighter or electrical arc in the tube. Their theoretical life span is 100,000
        hours,
        which is 10x more than standard fluorescents. Induction lights are about twice as efficient as standard
        fluorescents but
        still not as efficient as LEDs.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Interestingly, induction lights can interfere with cell and wifi signals, which might
        not
        be best for a home operation.
        They have the classic fluorescent hum, but on steroids and are so new they have little information online.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">How to decide</div>

      <div class="body">Not all grow lights are the same. If you can afford it, go with LEDs. They offer the best
        long-term operation with
        basically no heat and high efficiency. If you want something wide-scale, T5 lights are best. They are sold in
        almost
        every home improvement store as “shop lights”. HID lights simulate the full spectrum of light the sun outputs
        best
        and
        will produce the highest quality foods.
