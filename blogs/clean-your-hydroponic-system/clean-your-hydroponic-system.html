      <div class='pagetitle'>How to Clean your Hydroponic System</div>
      <div class="subtitle">A System Cleaning Guide</div>

      <img src="photos/hydroponic-roots.jpg" alt="clean hydroponic roots">
      <div class="bodyContinued">Today, we will provide some helpful tips and methods on how to clean your hydroponic
        system, maintain your hydroponic
        system, keep your nutrient reservoir in working condition, and flush and clean your whole system. Let's get it!
      </div>

      <div class="heading">Why Clean your System?</div>

      <div class="body">Cleaning the system is essential for any hydroponic operation, no matter the level. Pathogens,
        bacteria, and algae can
        quickly overtake a system if allowed to. Some diseases can ruin a crop of plants in days or even hours.
        Additionally,
        some diseases and issues can be hazardous to human health. A dirty system can have toxic water or even put
        harmful
        things into the air. So it’s essential to keep your system clean. The small cost and time required to clean your
        system
        will save you from headaches down the line.</div>

      <div class="heading">When is Cleaning Necessary?</div>

      <div class="subheading">Ongoing Maintenance</div>

      <div class="body">All systems need sanitization to keep clean. Basic maintenance is required to stay tidy and
        reduce the chances of an
        outbreak. Ongoing maintenance includes cleaning up water spills, removing dead plants, and washing air filters.
        This is
        part of your routine involved in managing your hydroponic system.</div>

      <div class="subheading">After a Harvest</div>

      <div class="body">Following each harvest, your system needs an intense cleaning. This guarantees no cross-over
        between one growth cycle to
        another. Preventing bacteria, pathogens, and algae is particularly important during the germination phase, so
        having a
        thoroughly clean system to start is double important. You can use harsher chemicals and cleaning methods between
        crop
        cycles, as it will not damage the plants.</div>

      <img src="photos/bacteria.jpg" alt="bacteria that needs to be cleaned from hydroponic system">

      <div class="subheading">Visible Signs of Bacteria, Fungi or Pathogens.</div>

      <div class="body">The sooner you act, the better, so as soon as you see signs of growth, attack. Side note: it may
        not be a big deal if
        you see algae. Algae is natural in any system and doesn’t have a huge impact. However, if algae start to consume
        your
        system, consider cleaning it.</div>

      <div class="heading">Materials Necessary for Cleaning your System</div>

      <div class="body">Before cleaning your system, find these tools and chemicals to get your system spotless.</div>

      <div class="heading">Step 1. Clear the System of All Plant Matter</div>

      <div class="body">You may have to skip this part if cleaning the system during a growth cycle. You may have lined
        up your schedule so that
        all of your plants harvest simultaneously, and you can skip most of this step. Either way, at least remove all
        dead
        plant matter. If you have to, relocate healthy crops elsewhere so you can clean the system thoroughly. That may
        be a
        mega hassle, but it will save your plants from further issues and ensure a deep, effective clean.</div>

      <img src="photos/water-drain.jpg" alt="water drain">

      <div class="heading">Step 2. Drain Liquid from the System</div>

      <div class="body">Now that all the plants are gone start by removing all liquids from your system. If you are
        going to recycle your water,
        consider draining the water to an alternate container while you clean your system. Check out our guide to
        recycling
        water. Drain your reservoir and other parts of the system as much as possible. Use a sponger or shop vac to suck
        up the
        remaining water if water remains.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">Step 3. Disassemble and Soak pieces</div>

      <div class="body">Break down your system into its smallest parts: Net cups, tubes, nozzles, air pumps, and growing
        medium. Then, soak it
        in a bath of cleaning chemicals and water. Soak for at least 5 minutes; more isn’t worse, though. Be sure to use
        caution and gloves while handling the cleaning
        solution; getting it on your skin is not great. For tubing, you can pour the solution down an end to fill the
        tube and
        get a good clean.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">Hydrogen Peroxide</div>

      <div class="body">If you’re using 35%, dilute to 1.5% with 20 parts water to 1 part hydrogen peroxide. If you’re
        using 3%, dilute to 1.5%
        with 2 parts water to 1 part hydrogen peroxide.
      </div>

      <img src="photos/bleach.jpg">

      <div class="subheading">Bleach</div>

      <div class="body">Bleach strength varies, so check the package to see what is best. Generally, one-third of a cup
        can be used for each
        gallon of water.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">Isopropyl Alcohol</div>

      <div class="body">If you’re using 99% isopropyl alcohol, mix 3 parts water with 1 part isopropyl alcohol. If you
        got 70%, use 2 parts
        water with 1 part isopropyl alcohol.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">Vinegar</div>

      <div class="body">Vinegar is incredible in that it is more natural than the rest of the cleaning solutions and not
        as harmful, but its not
        as strong. Mix 1 part water with 2 parts vinegar. You can add a few drops of soap to strengthen your solution if
        needed.</div>

      <img src="photos/scrub-brush.jpg" alt="scrub brush to clean hydroponic system">

      <div class="heading">Step 4. Scrub Up!</div>



      <div class="body">Fill a bucket with the same cleaning solution. Use a sponger or bristle brush to clean
        everything. Scrub until there is
        no residue left in the system. Wash it all off, then dry the system with a towel. Repeat this to ensure a CLEAN
        system.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Did you know the tubes of your system can be the dirtiest parts? This is because they
        have a constant supply of
        nutrients. Bacteria don't have to compete with plants for nutrients, so it's a prime environment for bacteria.
        If
        soaking your tubes isn’t enough, you can use a tube brush to clean your tubes.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">Step 5. Flush out your system</div>

      <div class="body">Fill up your system partially so your pumps can run. Then, let the system run for a couple hours
        to get all the leftover
        gunk out and to remove all the cleaning chemicals from the system. When you empty it this time, the system must
        get
        super dry.
      </div>


      <div class="heading">Step 6. Let Everything Else Dry
      </div>

      <div class="body">Use a towel to dry everything and let it air dry before using again. Avoid leaving anything wet
        inside your system; it
        may lead to bacteria, fungi, or pathogens getting into your system and wreaking havoc. If you want to accelerate
        the
        drying process, bring in fans or turn on your grow lights to provide some heat.
      </div>


      <div class="heading">Step 7. Clean the Grow Room
      </div>

      <div class="body">Finally, make sure your growing environment is clean. If you clean all of your equipment at
        once, excellent. Take the
        time to deep clean everything else in the room. Not only is this standard practice to have an organized
        workspace for
        your space, but it will also protect the system from outside influences. Vacuum the floors, dust the ceilings,
        clean the
        tables and dry it all out. Clean everything, even if its not visible. Dust, even in unreachable areas can have
        bacteria
        and potentially can get into the system.
      </div>


      <div class="heading">Optional Steps</div>

      <div class="body">These aren't necessary, but they can be great for your system.</div>

      <div class="heading">Ultraviolet Light/ Ozone Cleaning</div>

      <div class="body">Ultraviolet light and Ozone can be used in two situations: cleaning water and cleaning
        equipment.</div>

      <img src="photos/uv-light.jpeg">
      <div class="subheading">Cleaning Water
      </div>

      <div class="body">To clean water, put your ozone or UV into the reservoir and turn it on. Some research has shown
        that ozonated water and
        water treated with UV light have decreased bacteria levels, which can be good for your plants. Additionally, UV
        light
        may degrade chelates, a molecule that makes iron absorption easier for plants. Don't let this discourage you,
        though.
        Treating water with Ozone or UV can eliminate the risks of bacteria in your system.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">Cleaning Equipment</div>

      <div class="body">To use an ozone system to clean your hydroponic equipment, put everything you want to clean in a
        box, seal it off, and
        pump it full of ozone. The longer the treatment, the better. Be sure to either put the box outside or in an
        unoccupied
        room. Ozone isn’t good for you to breathe. It can cause irritation, chest pain, and coughing if you breathe it
        in. The
        good news is, that ozone breaks down into O2 fairly quickly. After 4 hours, the room will be safe for you to
        enter
        again.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">To use ultraviolet light to clean your system, Lay out equipment and arrange the UV
        lights above them. Blast them with
        UV light, flip over the equipment, and turn the lights back on. Avoid exposing your skin to UV light. UV light
        isn't
        good for you and can cause sunburn and cancer.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">Conclusion</div>

      <div class="body">You are done! If you follow this well, your system is in top shape to grow some plants.
        Regularly cleaning your system
        is key to having a happy and healthy system without any headaches.</div>
