      <div id="pagetitle">The Guide to Hydroponics At Home</div>
      <div class="body">So you’re interested in hydroponics? Good. Hydroponics is a new technology with old roots. We
        find
        traces of hydroponics
        as far back as the Aztecs. Today, hydroponics has blossomed into a 2.1 billion dollar industry. Starting your
        own
        hydroponic garden is easier than you think! This guide to home hydroponics will prepare you to build your own at
        home
        hydroponic garden. Let's get started!</div>

      <div class="heading">What is hydroponics?</div>

      <div class="body">Hydroponics is soilless gardening, plants are grown in a medium such as rocks, rock wool, or
        expanded clay instead of
        soil. Nutrients are provided via nutrient solutions. Hydroponic systems circulate the nutrients to the plants to
        provide
        an effective environment for growth. Lettuce and tomatoes are the most common things grown in hydroponic
        systems,
        but
        almost anything can be grown.

        Hydroponic systems can be installed almost anywhere. They can be in greenhouses, outside, in warehouses, or even
        in
        your
        own home. This versatility allows anyone, regardless of location or space, to construct a system to suit their
        needs
      </div>

      <div class="heading">Advantages of Hydroponics</div>

      <div class="subheading">Space</div>

      <div class="body">hydroponic gardens require very little space to operate, which makes them perfect for home
        hydroponics. They can be as
        big or as small as you would like. Since plants do not require any soil, plants can be placed closer together
        than
        in
        soil. Also, plants can be grown stacked on top of one another in a process called vertical gardening, further
        increasing
        space efficiency.</div>

      <div class="subheading">Water Usage</div>
      <img src="Photos/waterFaucet.jpg" alt="water faucet">
      <div class="body">While gardening is inherently eco-friendly, classic gardening loses a lot of water to
        evaporation.
        Water conservation is
        a key part of hydroponic growth. Hydroponic gardening uses 80% less water than traditional gardening. This is
        possible
        due to the decreased evaporation in hydroponic systems compared to traditional systems. Additionally, water can
        be
        reused in hydroponics to further decrease water usage.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">Finer Control</div>

      <div class="body">Hydroponics systems are completely controlled by you. This may sound scary, but I promise you it
        is
        an amazing thing.
        There are very few outside events than can influence your hydroponic system. This control allows you to make
        fine
        adjustments to your system as you see fit. You can change the nutrient solution, light levels, pH levels, and
        much
        more
        to optimize crop growth, quality, and health to ensure you harvest the best goods possible.</div>
      <div class="subheading">Faster Growth</div>
      <img src="Photos/graph-1.jpg" alt="graph showing hydroponics grows faster">
      <div class="body">Plants in hydroponic gardens typically grow 20% faster compared to plants grown in the ground.
        Since
        the roots of plants
        in hydroponic gardens are directly in nutrient solutions, they can absorb nutrients very quickly. Also, by using
        artificial light, we can extend the amount of time plants spend doing photosynthesis per day. Increasing growth
        allows
        for more crop cycles and minimizes the wait time between crop harvesting, enabling you to enjoy the fruits of
        your
        labor
        sooner.
      </div>
      <div class="subheading">Time Save</div>
      <div class="body">Once your hydroponic system is set up, there is little work left. Besides regulating water
        quality
        and ensuring the
        system is working as intended, there’s nothing to do except wait for your plants to bear fruit. There’s no need
        to
        weed
        anything, as they will not grow in your garden. And the risk of pests and diseases is significantly reduced.
        Being
        that
        there is no dirt to get you dirty, hydroponics is much cleaner than traditional gardening.</div>
      <div class="subheading">Cost</div>
      <img src="Photos/money.jpg" alt="stack of bills">
      <div class="body">Hydroponics can provide access for affordable, high-quality vegetables to all. This can be
        especially
        important for
        people without space for a traditional garden or located in food deserts. After your hydroponic garden is set
        up,
        the
        cost of growing your plants is minimal, especially if your system doesn’t use artificial light. The other large
        costs -
        water, nutrients, and temperature control can all be mitigated in various ways.</div>

      <div class="heading">Disadvantages of Hydroponics</div>
      <div class="subheading">Difficulty</div>
      <div class="body">While you shouldn’t let the challenges of hydroponics drive you away, there is a learning curve
        you’ll have to get
        through. This guide and other pieces of hydroponicsathome.com will help you along the way. Much of hydroponics
        is
        trial
        and error. There will be annoying issues you can't solve, but hydroponics is rewarding when treated correctly.
        The
        difficulty of hydroponics can become a fun adventure.</div>
      <div class="subheading">Electricity Consumption</div>
      <img src="Photos/electricty_meter.jpg" alt="electricity meter">
      <div class="body">Advanced hydroponics requires a slew of equipment: pH monitors, lights, motors, nutrient pumps,
        and
        temperature
        controls. You won’t have to worry as much about this now, but as you travel deeper into hydroponics electric
        costs
        can
        start to add up. To save money, consider checking out our guide to reducing costs.</div>
      <div class="subheading">Initial Cost</div>
      <div class="body">No lie, the initial cost of setting up a hydroponic system is not cheap. Most parts of a
        hydroponic
        system are one-time
        purchases, which is awesome for longevity, but bad for initial commitment. By building your own systems and
        researching
        beforehand, you can reduce the cost.</div>

      <div class="heading">Types of Hydroponic Systems</div>
      <div class="body">While there are many different types of hydroponic systems, for at home, beginner hydroponic
        systems
        you have 2
        realistic options.</div>
      <div class="subheading">Deep Water Culture</div>
      <img src="./Photos/DWC.png" alt="DWC Diagram">
      <div class="body">Also known as DWC, this style is the simplest and
        cheapest for small-scale farms. DWC systems have
        plants suspended
        above buckets or tanks of nutrient-filled water, while the roots of the plants are in the water. Plants are
        grown
        in
        Rockwool, peat plugs, or expanded clay in net cups. Airstones are placed in the tanks to provide proper root
        oxygenation.

      </div>
      <div class="subheading">Nutrient Film Technique</div>
      <img src="./Photos/NFT.png" alt="NTF Diagram">

      <div class="body">Also known as NFT, this style is recommended for more ambitious hydroponic gardeners. NTF
        systems
        are comprised of long
        (typically PVC) pipes with holes cut out on top for plants to grow in. A nutrient solution is cycled through the
        pipes
        to provide nutrients to the plants.

        The main reservoir holds the water and a pump circulates the water to the pipes. Several times throughout the
        day,
        nutrients are injected into the water stream to feed the plants. This provides fresh, oxygenated water to the
        plants
        24/7. Monitoring is required to keep plant roots from turning brown, a sign of oxygen deprivation.

        Let's
        learn
        about how to care
        for a hydroponic system.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">Germination</div>
      <img src="Photos/Germination.png">
      <div class="caption">Maky Orel <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en">License</a>
      </div>

      <div class="body">The first step in building your at home hydroponic system is germination. Germination with
        hydroponics is very easy.
        Simply place your seeds into the growing medium (Rockwool, rock, expanded clay). Then, water the seeds with a
        half-strength nutrient solution. You can determine the necessary nutrient strength by looking at the nutrient
        packaging.
        Place the seeds in a warm sunny location or under artificial lighting for 16 hours per day. If possible, cover
        the
        plants with clear plastic to increase humidity. If these steps are followed, you can expect to get a 90%
        germination
        rate.

        The amount of time before you can transplant the plants to your hydroponic systems varies depending on what
        plant
        you’re
        growing. The guide below shows how long it takes before you can transplant seedlings. Your plants may be ready
        before or
        after the dates. To determine if your plants are ready to be transplanted, check out our guide on transplanting

      <div class="heading">Growing</div>
      <div class="body">Once the plants are in your hydroponic system you’re on the home straight. Making sure your
        system
        is in order is easy
        and you’re weeks away from delicious hydroponically grown food.</div>
      <div class="subheading">Lighting</div>
      <img src="Photos/grow_lights.jpg" alt="grow lights">

      </div>
      <div class="body">If you’re growing plants outdoor/ with natural light, It’s best to place your at home hydroponic
        system where it will
        get sun all day. Since your plant will be getting water all day, there’s no worry of the plants drying out due
        to
        too
        much sun.

        If you’re growing your plants with artificial light, It's best to have them in the light for 18 hours per day.
        This
        may
        seem extreme as plants never receive that much light naturally, but the enhanced growing conditions provided by
        your
        at
        home hydroponic system allows for the increased light duration.
      </div>
      <div class="subheading">Water</div>
      <div class="body">Maintaining good water quality is the most important thing you have to do while growing your
        plants.
        It starts by making
        sure before you put water into the system, that the system is extremely clean. You can clean your system
        following
        our
        simple system cleaning guide.
      </div>
      <div class="bodyContinued">
        The water you put into your system should be clean, it’s best to use reverse osmosis/ distilled water, but tap
        water
        will do. You can add nutrients to the water before or after your put it in the system, commonly it’s easiest to
        do
        before. Follow the nutrient recommendations on the packaging to determine how much nutrient to add.

        Twice per week, you should measure the electrical conductivity(EC) and pH levels of your system. You can
        regulate
        the pH
        by using pH up and down solutions. It’s best to keep the pH of your system between 5.5 and 6.5. Regulating EC
        can
        be
        challenging. You should aim for an EC of 1.6, but it will take some trial and error to determine the best way to
        regulate EC for your at home hydroponic system.
      </div>
      <div class="bodyContinued">
        It's almost inevitable that you will get algae in your system. It can be reduced by keeping a clean system and
        using
        opaque containers, but you will always have some. Don’t worry too much about algae. It may be ugly, and
        annoying,
        and it
        will consume some of your fertilizer, but it’s harmless to your plants. If algae completely overtake your
        system,
        you
        may want to use an algaecide. It’s not necessary, but that choice is up to you.
      </div>
      <div class="subheading">Harvesting</div>
      <img src="Photos/tomatoe_harvest.jpg" alt="basket of tomaotes">
      <div class="body">Once your plants are ready to be harvested, you must take caution to not hurt your plants or
        system.
        It’s recommended
        you use clean gloves as you make get nutrient solution on your hands, which isn’t great for you. If you’re
        harvesting
        plants where you take the whole plant, like lettuce, you should take the plant, and save the growing medium if
        possible
        for another cycle. One of the best things about harvesting in hydroponics is there’s really no need to wash your
        food.
        It was grown in no soil, and the environment has been relatively clean.
