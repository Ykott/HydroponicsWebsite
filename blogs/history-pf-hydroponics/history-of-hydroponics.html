      <div class='pagetitle'>The History of Hydroponics
      </div>
      <div class="body">Jump to <a href=#flydown>The History of Hydroponic Cannabis</a></div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Hydroponics is the practice of growing plants without soil. Hydroponics comes from
        hydro, meaning water, and ponos,
        meaning labor. Hydroponics has proliferated over the past century. Hydroponic systems today are hyper-complex
        and
        involve sensors and computers. They are at the forefront of agriculture and technology. However, looking into
        the past,
        we see a simpler beginning for hydroponics.</div>

      <div class="heading">600 BC: The Hanging Gardens Of Babylon
      </div>

      <div class="body">Descriptions of the mysterious Gardens of Babylon come from the ancient greeks. Strabo and Philo
        of Byzantium are our
        best sources for the gardens. They described the gardens as having “plants cultivated above ground level” and
        the “roots
        of trees embedded in an upper terrace rather than earth”. Maybe not precisely hydroponics, but that does sound
        close to
        it. Further ancient writings state:
      </div>

      <div class="quote">“Streams of water emerging from elevated sources flow partly in a straight line down sloping
        channels and are partly
        forced upwards through bends and spirals to gush out higher up, being impelled through the twists of those
        devices by
        mechanical forces.”
      </div>

      <div class="author">Philo of Byzantium</div>

      <img src="photos/philo-of-byzantium.jpg" alt="philo of byzantium">
      <div class="body">The garden had extensive
        irrigation systems, similar to hydroponics. By raising water from the
        Euphrates river, they
        could water their plants high above. Sadly, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon aren’t exactly hydroponics. A further
        quote
        by Philo references the plants being grown in dirt:
      </div>

      <div class="quote">“It consists of vaulted terraces raised above one another and resting upon cube-shaped pillars.
        These are hollow and
        filled with earth, allowing trees of the largest size to be planted.”
      </div>

      <div class="author">Philo of Byzantium</div>

      <div class="body">So not perfect hydroponics. The advanced irrigation systems of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon
        laid the foundations that
        hydroponics stand on today.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">The existence of the gardens is debated. There has been no concrete proof of the
        gardens, and only five primary sources
        have been found (though there are very few surviving ancient greek documents in general). Nevertheless, the
        gardens are
        one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, along with the Great Pyramids of Giza, the Temple of Artemis at
        Ephesus,
        the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Mausoleum at Halicarnasus, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the Pharos Lighthouse
        at
        Alexandria.

      </div>

      <div class="heading">1100 AD: Aztec Floating Gardens</div>

      <div class="body">Another ancient example of hydroponic like activity is the Aztec floating gardens. Surrounding
        Tenochtitlan, the Aztec
        capital city, was a vast lake. Through a long process of trial and error, the Aztecs living on the lake learned
        to build
        rafts of reeds and leaves held together with tough roots to form large rafts. They loaded the rafts with rich
        soil
        dredged from the bottom of the lake. The mud from the lake provided superb nutrients for the plants to grow, and
        the
        surrounding lake provided constant irrigation to the rafts. As the rafts grew in size, they became more like
        floating
        islands. Farmers built houses on top of them, planted trees, and produced food. The plants would grow through
        the rafts
        so their roots were directly in the lake water. This is very similar to hydroponics. Although not soilless, the
        roots
        were directly exposed to the water, like hydroponics.</div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">At times, many of these rafts would combine to form islands the length of a football
        field. When the Spaniards arrived
        in the new world, they were amazed by the farming methods of the Aztecs. William Prescott, a historian who
        followed the
        Spaniards, described the chinampas as “Wondering Islands of Verdure, teeming with flowers and vegetables and
        moving like
        rafts over the water”. Chinampas were so effective that they were used as a way of living well into the 1800s.

      <div class="heading">1300 AD: Chinese Rice Feilds</div>

      <div class="body">Rice terraces are mostly found in Southeast Asia due to its ideal climate and geographical
        location. Rice terraces were
        built as cuts into the mountainside. Water is stored at the top of the mountain and is directed down the
        mountain to
        water the rice. After three weeks of growing, the rice seed is transplanted to its terraces filled with 6 inches
        of
        water. Transplanting the seed gives the rice a head start against weeds and pests. As the plants grow, the water
        level
        will fall until the ground is dry and the rice is ready to harvest.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Again, not an exact version of hydroponics (and this one is a bit more of a stretch
        than the others.) Although, the 6
        inches of water is similar to the Deep Water Culture (DWC) hydroponics technique. Maybe check out our 5-gallon
        bucket
        guide for DWC! This method of rice growing continues to be practiced today.

      <div class="heading">1627 AD: Sylva Sylvarum
      </div>

      <div class="body">This book by Francis Bacon and William Rawley was revolutionary. It is the first written
        reference to growing plants
        without any soil. Published after his death, It details Sir Francis Bacon’s research into soilless plants.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">1648 AD: Scientific Study Into Hydroponics
      </div>

      <div class="body">Our earliest experiments into the parts that make up plant growth were in 1600 by Jan van
        Helmont. Helmont performed the
        famous Willow Shoot Experiment, which showed that plants needed more than just dirt. He was a little off, he
        thought
        plants got all of their mass from water when they got it from the air too, but he was getting there.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">In 1699, John Woodward, a scientist, recorded the first case of plants grown truly
        hydroponically. He grew plants with
        various types of soil mixed with water and found that plants grew well when combined with a lot of soil.
        Basically,
        Woodward made a fertilizer solution from dirt! Of course, Woodward didn’t know what he was doing when he did
        this, nor
        did Woodward know specifically why dirt and water were good for plants, but what he did was amazing.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Following Woodward's research, scientists continued to make breakthroughs. For example,
        they determined that water is
        absorbed by plant roots and plants exchange air through their leaves. They also found that plants take up
        nutrients from
        the soil.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">More research made a list of 9 elements required for plant growth. Jean Baptiste
        Bossingault confirmed this list as
        accurate and began an agricultural chemical supply company in 1850. They started to grow plants in sand, quartz,
        and
        charcoal while supplying them with the nine essential elements. Further discoveries and developments led to
        Wilhelm Knop
        founding the modern methods we use in hydroponics and has been nicknamed “The Father of Water Culture.”
      </div>

      <div class="heading">True Hydroponics
      </div>
      autonomous hydroponics
      <div class="body">In the 1920s, Dr. William F. Greicke from the US began experimenting with the practical
        application of plant nutrition
        on a large scale. He coined the term “hydroponics” because of the greek meaning “water-working” He is considered
        the
        true founder of hydroponics and growing plants without soil. US government interest began to develop in 1925.
        Greenhouse
        soil had to be replaced or heavily fertilized annually. Hydroponics could solve all of these issues. US
        government
        research workers experimented on soilless culture methods (hydroponics) to replace soil. The results were okay
        due to
        hydroponic’s resource-intense nature.

      <div class="heading">Commercial Hydroponics
      </div>

      <div class="body">Following WWII, a few large hydroponic operations were set up in the US, mainly in Florida and
        the Southwest. Many were
        outdoors and suffered from poor construction, management and weather. One large problem was caused by lime in
        the
        concrete leaching into the nutrient solution and poisoning the crops. In addition, metals and other heavy
        elements
        entered the system, turning the plants toxic and uneatable.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">In the 1960s, when plastics began to take over the world, interest in hydroponics was
        renewed. Plastic piping and lining
        were much cheaper than traditionally used metal and concrete. Large investments were made in hydroponics growing
        systems. However, rising oil prices in the 1970s substantially increased heating and cooling costs. This and the
        banning
        of DDT caused the bankruptcy of many hydroponic facilities.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">After the initial failures, improvements were made, and there are many commercial
        hydroponic systems today. Hydroponics
        is feasibly used by many companies where soil gardening is not possible. Prime examples include oil and mining
        companies. They are located in areas without arable land, so hydroponics works well for them.

      <div class="heading">Hydroponics at War
      </div>

      <div class="body">Hydroponics found a strong foothold in World War II. In wartime, shipping fresh fruits and
        vegetables overseas are not
        possible. It is a waste of resources and expensive to ship; typical vegetable shipments were delivered via an
        airdrop,
        which was very inefficient. Hydroponics provided a method for soldiers to grow plants in the non-arable pacific
        islands
        in the 1940s. On the homefront, hydroponics was encouraged by the British government's “Grow More Food” Campaign
        between
        1939 and 1945.

      <div class="heading">History of
        Hydroponic Cannabis
      </div>

      <div class="body">In the 1980s, hydroponics was embraced as a method to grow cannabis. It largely came from
        Richard Nixon's crackdown on
        cannabis from Mexico. The US needed a way to grow high-quality cannabis cheaply and quietly. High-intensity
        discharge
        indoor grow lights also became available around then. This made growing marijuana attractive to many and
        possible for
        most. Companies began to grow large solely based on providing services for growing marijuana with complicated
        hydroponic
        systems.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">The Dutch, prolific and efficient farmers, brought cannabis-growing tech to a new
        level. They have championed cloning
        methods, seed breeding, new growing mediums, nutrient technology, and CO2 infusion. The Dutch government has
        allowed for
        huge cannabis-growing hydroponic systems to be built and deployed. In addition, they allowed many small stores
        to sell
        cannabis and hash to people, a rarity in our world. Once hydroponic cannabis took off, cannabis suppliers from
        places
        like North Africa and the Middle East lost a lot of traction.
