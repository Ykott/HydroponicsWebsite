      <div class="body">If you’re really against reusing it, jump to <a href="">How to Dispose of your Hydroponic
          Wastewater</a></div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">There are many things can you can do to upgrade your hydroponic system. Recycling water
        is just one of those ways. It
        can reduce your water usage, reduce your nutrient usage and save you some money!</div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Plants grown hydroponically already have insane water conservation compared to
        traditional agriculture, up to 90% less.
        This is due to reduced evaporation in hydroponic systems and near-perfect irrigation from water constantly
        touching the
        plant's roots.</div>

      <img src="photos/hydroponic-roots.jpg" alt="hydroponic roots">

      <div class="bodyContinued">Don't forget the first step to being able to recycle your water is having clean water
        to start. Start your system with
        the purest water possible, preferably distilled or reverse osmosis water, but tap will do. Once in your system,
        control
        the Ph and EC of your system to maintain “healthy” water.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Our beginner's guide will take you through the simple process of reusing your water. It
        will cost you some money and
        take you some time. There are three main ways to recycle your water and a couple of alternative methods. Let's
        take a
        look!
      </div>



      <div class="heading">Why you Should Clean and Reuse your Water</div>

      <div class="body">There are so many benefits of hydroponics, but the biggest negative that I’ve ever seen is the
        excessive amounts of
        wastewater produced from your system. In systems that don't reuse water, half of the water put into the system
        is taken
        out as wastewater. It takes a ton of time to dump out your water, clean the reservoir, fill it with new water,
        add
        nutrients, and balance the pH.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Hydroponic wastewater is something to be careful with. Wastewater contains nutrients
        like nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur,
        zinc, and calcium. While effective in supporting plant growth, these nutrients are not great to put down the
        drain.
        Therefore, many cities, counties, and towns have rules for dumping fertilized wastewater. There are hefty fines
        involved
        if you mishandle your wastewater. You probably won't get caught, but it’s still the right thing to do.
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">If dumped down the drain, high nitrogen and phosphorous levels from fertilizers found
        in hydroponic wastewater can be
        harmful. Once dumped down the drain, hydroponic wastewater can enter the environment. Once in the environment,
        wastewater can promote the growth of large amounts of algae, potentially causing algae blooms. Algae blooms are
        very
        harmful to the environment. Algae blooms can:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li class="indentedlist">Produce toxins in the water that can hurt or even kill plants, animals, and fish
          nearby. Humans can also become sick.
        </li>

        <li class="indentedlist">Create areas of low oxygen. By covering the entire surface of a body of water with
          algae, light and oxygen cannot enter
          the water. This creates a “dead zone” where plants die from lack of sunlight and fish drown from no oxygen.
        </li>

        <li class="indentedlist">Force governments and companies to spend large amounts of money to clean up bodies of
          water.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="bodyContinued">So it is essential to manage your hydroponic wastewater well, and reusing it is a
        straightforward way to manage your
        wastewater. As a bonus, recycling your hydroponic wastewater can be cost-saving in the long run.</div>

      <div class="body">Pasteurization is used all the time in our world. It cleans our milk, juice, eggs, beer, canned
        food, and syrup. It
        kills bacteria (good and bad alike) usually present in those liquids and allows for long-term storage.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Pasteurization is used in hydroponics to kill bacteria, so you can keep reusing that
        water. The process works by rapidly
        heating the liquid with heat exchangers designed to swap heat between 2 substances quickly. The hot fluid is
        held above
        203 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 seconds. Then the process goes reverse, and the liquid is cooled rapidly back to
        room
        temperature. This process kills all life in the water. Filtering your water before or after using a
        pasteurization
        system is unnecessary. Frequent cleaning of the pasteurization system is necessary to prevent excess buildup of
        minerals
        in the machine.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">The best way to get a pasteurization system is second-hand online. There are tons of
        old milk/beer pasteurization tanks
        online for cheap. They may turn out to be broken garbage, but that's the risk you have to take. If you want to
        take the
        safe route, you can buy a pasteurization system at a local farm supply store. Some are sold online, but it’s
        expensive
        to ship, and the quality is suspect.

      <div class="body">The first step in ozonation is to filter the water with a 50-micron filter to remove any large
        contaminants. This won't
        remove nutrients, most algae, and organic matter, but it will get the big stuff. Then reduce the system's pH to
        4.0 to
        get the best results. Finally, ozonate the system.</div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Ozone is an oxygen-based molecule composed of 3 oxygen atoms, it makes up the layer in
        our atmosphere that blocks UV
        rays from entering our planet. Ozone kills organic material by binding to it, oxidizing it with one of its
        oxygen atoms,
        and the other two leave as normal O2. Oxidizing the organic matter neutralizes it.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">There are two major types of ozone generators: ultraviolet and corona discharge. Ozone
        generators create ozone by
        breaking molecules into individual atoms, then binding 3 of them back together into ozone. Then, ozone is
        injected into
        the water to kill living organic matter.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Ozonation is by far the most effective sterilizer on this list. It works fast and
        effectively, then leaves with no
        residue. It has no environmental impact and doesn't use much energy.

      <div class="body">UV disinfection uses light to clean your water. It uses Ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet has a
        higher frequency and
        shorter wavelength than visible light. UV disinfection works by destroying the DNA of the cell with UV rays.
        Then the
        cells die as they have no “brains” to live with.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">There are three types of UV radiation: UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C, each defined by its
        frequency and wavelength. UV
        disinfection uses UV-C radiation to kill bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Two hundred fifty millijoules per cubic
        centimeter is the appropriate radiation level to disinfect water.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">To disinfect water, start by filtering the water with a 50-micron water filter to
        remove large particles. Then disinfect
        with UV. If you’re using a radiation chamber, pump the water through the radiation chamber to disinfect, if
        you’re using
        a submersible system, place it in water and circulate water around the UV light.

      <div class="heading">Alternatives</div>

      <img src="photos/watering-plants.jpg" alt="watering traditionally grown plants">
      <div class="subheading">Use
        Wastewater on Plants
      </div>

      <div class="body">If you are against reusing your wastewater traditionally, consider watering traditionally grown
        plants with it. Water
        down the wastewater to one part water to one part wastewater. Don't water plants directly in the ground, as you
        may have
        the same issues with traditionally dumping wastewater—only water plants in contained pots.</div>


      <div class="subheading">Reverse Osmosis</div>

      <div class="body">This method is commonly used to treat town water to increase taste and reduce hardness. It works
        by forcing water
        through a semipermeable membrane that leaves contaminants behind. These are great as they remove everything from
        the
        water, so you’re guaranteed clean water for your system. But they remove EVERYTHING, including the nutrients you
        are
        growing your plants with. So you do get to reuse your water, but you have to add more nutrients. Also, these
        filters can
        get clogged by the excess nutrients and organic matter in the hydroponic wastewater.</div>

      <img src="photos/hydrogen-peroxide.jpg" alt="hydrogen peroxide bottle">

      <div class="subheading">Hydrogen Peroxide</div>

      <div class="body">This is very similar to ozonation. The H2O2 molecule does the same thing that the O3 molecule
        does. However, it's not as
        effective as Ozone. It does do well with killing bacteria, but if you use a large amount, you can disinfect your
        wastewater with this. Additionally, using large amounts of hydrogen peroxide in your system can harm your
        plants.</div>

      <div class="caption">Marc bouk<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en">License</a></div>

      <div class="subheading">Iodine</div>

      <div class="body">This is not recommended. Iodine can kill viruses and bacteria, so its used to clean drinking
        water in a pinch. But
        iodine cannot kill some horticulture viruses, so it is not super practical for hydroponic water.
