      <div class="body">Want to start or expand your hydroponic setup, but don’t have space? Consider vertical
        gardening,
        a hot trend in the
        gardening space. Vertical gardening is growing stacked plants on top of each other. Vertical hydroponic gardens
        can fit
        into any small space, improve productivity per square foot, and look beautiful. They’re perfect for small
        backyards,
        patios, porches, and even indoor areas. Learn about vertical gardens, what to do with them and how to start one
        below!</div>

      <div class="heading">The Benefits of Vertical Gardens</div>

      <div class="body">Growing upwards can reduce the heating/cooling costs. Since the space taken up by a vertical
        garden would normally just
        be empty space that needs to be cooled, the vertical garden is basically receiving free cooling/heating.</div>

      <div class="bodyContinued"> Stacking plants on top of each other obviously works to maximize yields. Since you are
        using more space, a vertical
        garden is more space efficient.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Maintaining a vertical hydroponic garden is also easier. Since much of the garden is
        above the ground, you don't have to
        bend over/kneel down as much to harvest/care for plants.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Vertical gardens tend to look better than normal hydroponic gardens. The layers of
        green
        plants draw attention away from
        the arguably ugly hydroponic system below. Vertical gardens can be used to block views of lesser-looking things
        too.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued"> Vertical hydroponic gardens can save even more water than normal hydroponic gardens.
        By
        stacking them on top of each
        other you can use the same reservoir for each level, saving more water and requiring less maintenance.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">Best Plants for Vertical Hydroponic Gardens</div>

      <div class="body">In general, the best plants for vertical gardens are short, don't need a trellis, and are pretty
        hardy. Though, with a
        proper setup, any plant can be grown in a vertical hydroponic garden.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Microgreens - Super short, grow fast, yield year-round, nutritious, quick turn around
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Lettuce - Compact, easy to care for, universally liked, cheap
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Strawberries - tasty, produces yield round, easy to harvest
      </div>

      <div class="heading">How Does it Work?</div>

      <div class="body">As a quick recap, hydroponics is soilless gardening. Plants are grown in a non-soil medium like
        Rockwool, expanded clay,
        or gravel. Nutrients are delivered via fertilizer solutions. Hydroponic systems circulate the nutrients to the
        plants to
        provide an effective environment for growth. Hydroponic systems grow plants faster, healthier, and cleaner than
        traditional gardening. If you want to know more about how hydroponics works, check out <a
          href="../hydro-guide/hydro-guide.html">our guide.</a></div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">There are several ways to build a vertical hydroponic garden. Before exploring specific
        methods, lets look at the 2 different types of vertical gardens. In general, vertical hydroponics uses either a
        vertical pipe tower or a horizontal pipe
        tower arrangement.
      </div>

      <div class="caption">Battledp <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en">License</a></div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">A vertical pipe tower uses a long (typically PVC) pipe to grow plants. Plants are grown
        in net cups filled with Rockwool
        angled 45 degrees into the pipe. The roots of the plant grow into the pipe to suck up nutrients. A tube is
        attached to a
        nutrient and water reservoir at the base of the tower. A water pump will pump the water from the reservoir to
        the
        top of
        the tower, then the water will trickle down the pipe, watering the plants and providing them with nutrients
        before
        returning to the reservoir at the base of the tower to be reused.
      </div>

      <img src="photos/horizontal_garden.jpg">
      <div class="caption"> GreensGrow</div>
      <div class="bodyContinued">A horizontal pipe tower is typically larger scale than a vertical
        pipe tower. Horizontal
        pipe towers use the nutrient
        film technique (NFT) to grow plants. Several horizontal pipes are stacked on top of each other. Plants are grown
        in net
        cups sitting inside the pipes. The roots, again, grow into the pipe for water and nutrients. Water is pumped
        from
        the
        reservoir to each pipe (each pipe gets its own water line) and flows through the pipe and returns to the
        reservoir. In
        this system, artificial lights may be installed between pipes to provide extra light to plants, although this
        may
        not be
        necessary.

      <div class="body">A really simple vertical pipe tower. This tower is quite rudimentary, which is awesome for a
        quick
        build. Built out of
        PVC and other simple materials, this is the ultimate budget setup for beginners. If you’re looking for a day
        project for
        your kids or just to get your feet wet, this is it. The tower definitely isn't the most efficient though. The
        water
        distribution system is not perfect, there’s a lot of space at the bottom for the reservoir, and it’s not the
        best-looking vertical hydroponic garden out there. Light shouldn’t be a problem in this system, as plants are
        spaced out
        well</div>

        allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <div class="body">Out favorite vertical hydroponic system by far. It is a little more complicated to build, but it
        looks beautiful in a
        backyard. This system is super space efficient for an at-home system due to the large number of plants in the
        small
        space. It shouldn’t even require extra light if you angle the frame to track the sun. We don’t recommend this
        style of
        system for complete beginners, though a little challenge never hurt anyone. The pumping can be quite complicated
        to set
        up since the water does not flow in the same direction for each pipe, and the water quality can swing quickly
        since
        there are so many plants relying on one reservoir.

      <div class="subheading">Zig–Zag Hydroponic System</div>

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rj4MzjxjGck" title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <div class="body">A zig-zag hydroponic system is the simplest horizontal pipe tower. It's our pick for the
        best-looking vertical
        hydroponic system, especially if you plant colorful plants in the system. The pumping system is easy. Just a
        line
        from
        the reservoir up to the top pipe, the water will meander its way down all the pipes back into the reservoir. You
        must be
        careful though, if a plant at the top gets a disease, it will give all of the plants downstream the disease.
        That's not
        a major risk, but it's something to consider.

        frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <div class="body">This simple vertical hydroponic garden uses the house as the backbone of the system. It’s
        cheaper
        to build than most
        horizontal pipe systems and is compact against the wall. Overall, this is an awesome idea, but it comes with a
        major
        flaw: light. The house will block a lot of light from reaching the plants. Half the day the plants will be in
        the
        shade
        due to the house. Plants that need full sun for 8 hours a day may struggle to grow well in a setup like this.
      </div>

      <div class="subheading">Indoor System</div>

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zhzoijrXfJs" title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <div class="body">This is an awesome indoor system. It does use artificial lights, which is a little expensive,
        but
        it guarantees full
        light for plants on command. It's the most compact system on this list too, with plants directly on top of each
        other.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">Things to Consider</div>

      <div class="body">If you’re ready to try building a vertical hydroponics garden, good! But here's a few things to
        consider before getting
        started.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Your plants LOVE light. Especially in a hydroponic system where they get over-nurtured.
        Outdoors, be sure to arrange
        your plants to maximize time in the full sun per day. If absolutely necessary, supplemental light can be used.
        Indoors,
        It gets a little tricky. If near windows, the plants will get some light, but it may not be enough. Each level
        must
        receive enough light to promote healthy growth.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">This is not a set-and-forget activity. Hydroponics requires time and commitment to
        guarantee your plants grow. Plants
        need management, you need to track water quality, light input, plant health, and more. Along the way, you’re
        going
        to
        make mistakes, find out new things, and discover better ways to do things.
      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Things are going to break. Even the perfect setup is going to have issues. Leaks,
        cracks,
        broken lines, and dead motors
        are going to happen from time to time. Broken things are going to hurt your plants, so make an effort to check
        on
        things
        every day.

      </div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Hydroponics has a high initial investment. While the production in vertical hydroponic
        gardens is high, the cost of the
        resources required to manage and grow those plants is great. Most of the cost is a one-time investment: light
        panels,
        pump, piping, reservoirs, and building materials, so after construction, your hydroponic system should be close
        to
        pure
        profit.
      </div>

      <div class="heading">Questions</div>

      <div class="body">By no means is this guide complete, but it is a great start. If you’re ready to get started,
        consider checking our guide
        to at home hydroponics. If you have any questions, drop us an email at hydroponicsathome.us@gmail.com</div>

      <div class="heading">Conclusion</div>

      <div class="body">No hydroponic system is going to be perfect, but vertical systems are close. As long as you keep
        in mind the cost and
        time commitment necessary for a system, you’re set up for success. The few disadvantages of a vertical
        hydroponic
        system
        are more than made up for with the higher yield and productivity.</div>

      <div class="bodyContinued">Hydroponics is exciting, I can't wait for your journey to start!</div>
